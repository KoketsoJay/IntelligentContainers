# Dev Environment Setup

These are the steps of one of the ways to start developing and deploying cloud-native solutions targeting Azure.

## Azure Account

To complete this how-to, you need an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) before you begin.

## Azure CLI

Download and install [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) for your relevant OS.

## Docker Desktop

[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) is the way to go to build cloud-ready on your desktop.

## VS Code

Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### VS Code Extension

I would highly recommend installing the following extensions:
